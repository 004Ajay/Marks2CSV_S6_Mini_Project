I have an idea to make automated scanning and adding marks to an excel sheet using OCR & spreadsheet


Our teachers are wasting 4 hours of their productive time entering marks scored by students on individual questions to excel sheets. so I am planning to solve this problem by making a WhatsApp bot to receive a pdf of those answer sheets from teachers and scan the contents of that pdf using an OCR tool made in python and enter relevant details like student name, marks scored on an individual question to an excel sheet and send it to them through the same bot within the least time as possible

Questions:

1. How to make a whatsapp bot
2. How to integrate an OCR tool in whatsapp bot
3. Where to host the bot, or i need to put in my laptop only, but i need the bot to be working 24x7

1. OMR Sheets: Optical Mark Recognition Sheets, are a type of form used to collect data through the use of a pen or pencil. They are typically used for multiple-choice tests, surveys, and other types of data collection where a person needs to mark their responses by filling in circles or boxes. The OMR sheet will have a series of bubbles or boxes printed on it, each corresponding to a question or answer choice. The person taking the test or survey will fill in the bubbles or boxes with a pen or pencil, and the sheet is then scanned to collect the data. The scanned image is then processed using OMR software to extract the data and it can be further used for analysis. OMR sheets are commonly used in educational institutions, government organizations and businesses to collect data quickly and efficiently.

Q) How to create a bot in telegram and host it using github

A) To create a Telegram bot, you will first need to create a new bot by talking to the BotFather on Telegram. Once you have created a bot, you will be given a token that you will use to interact with the Telegram API.

To host your bot on GitHub, you will need to create a new repository on GitHub and push your code to it. You will also need to make sure that your code is set up to run on a server, as GitHub is only used for storing and versioning code.

Once you have your code on GitHub, you will need to set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically deploy your code to a server when you push new changes to GitHub. This can be done using a service like GitHub Actions or Travis CI.

Finally, you will need to make sure that your server is configured correctly and running your bot code. You can do this by running your code on the server and using the Telegram API to send messages to your bot to test its functionality.


Q) How to deploy a telegram bot using github as the version control and google cloud as the hosting service

A) To deploy a Telegram bot using GitHub as the version control and Google Cloud as the hosting service, you can follow these steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub to store the code for your Telegram bot.

Connect your GitHub repository to a Google Cloud project by using GitHub as a source in Google Cloud Source Repositories.

Create a new virtual machine instance on Google Cloud and install the necessary dependencies for running your Telegram bot.

Use the Google Cloud SDK to deploy your code from the GitHub repository to the virtual machine instance.

Set up a webhook for your Telegram bot on the virtual machine instance, and configure it to listen for incoming messages.

Test your Telegram bot by sending messages to it and verifying that it responds correctly.

If everything is working correctly, configure the virtual machine instance to run your Telegram bot automatically after a reboot or when the instance is started.

Note: The above steps are general guidelines, and you may need to adapt them depending on your specific requirements and the programming language you are using for your Telegram bot.
