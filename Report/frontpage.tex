  \textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}
Sample: A web application for managing various blood banks and donor-recipient operations efficiently is being focused. The project consists of a central repository of various blood deposits and donors available along with their associated details hosted on a cloud server. These details include donor name, blood type, medical details and location details. The project provides options to search and find whether a particular blood group is available in any of the blood banks or among the registered blood donors
efficiently using cloud server. Search results would be listed
based on the distance from the requester. The system generates emails requesting blood to the selected donors. Based on donor response and preference the system will provide the personal details, contact information and direction to each other using Google Geo location services. Moreover, the system will have added features such as posting blood campaign invitations on the dashboard and shows live blood request as a popup notification in the homepage. This online life saviour system is developed on PHP with Azure cloud platform and supported by Azure SQL database.
