  \textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}
This project involves the development of a user-friendly software tool that utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to convert scanned images of answer papers into Excel sheets. The primary focus of the tool is to accurately extract marks written in specific boxes on the answer papers and organize them in a structured format for further analysis and manipulation.\\
\\
\noindent The primary objective of this project is to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to solve a real-life problem that involves the manual entry of mark data by teachers. By employing advanced OCR algorithms and leveraging data processing techniques, the software tool aims to deliver reliable and precise results, thereby minimizing errors and ensuring the integrity of the extracted marks. This project holds significant potential in the field of education, particularly for educational institutions. The tool can streamline the labor-intensive task of grading exams by automating the process of extracting marks from answer papers. It offers educational institutions a reliable and efficient solution that saves time, reduces manual effort, and facilitates insightful analysis of the data.\\
\\
\noindent The software tool operates by capturing a picture of the front page of the answer sheet where the marks are written using a camera as input and then converting it using our proprietary methods. To enhance the usability and flexibility of the tool, widely-used frameworks such as TensorFlow, Numpy, and Pandas are utilized to organize and format the extracted marks. The end result is a comprehensive Excel sheet that faithfully represents the original content of the
answer papers, making it effortless for users to edit, analyze, and evaluate the data. By combining cutting-edge OCR technology, robust data processing frameworks, and a user-friendly approach, this project aims to provide a software tool that revolutionizes the grading process in educational institutions, ultimately enhancing productivity and decision-making capabilities.
