step-by-step algorithm for the mini project code:

1. Import the following libraries:
	- img2table.document
	- img2table.ocr
	- pandas
	- pdf2image
	- PIL
	- io

2. Create a dictionary to store the marks of each paper. The keys of the dictionary should be the question number (1a, 1b,..,12c), and the values should be lists of marks.

3. Convert the PDF file to images using the pdf2image library.

4. For each image:
	- Crop the image to the area containing the marks.
	- Perform OCR on the image using an ocr program of ocr file from img2table library.
	- Extract the table from the OCR results.
	- Drop the first, last row and first column of the table.
	- Flatten the table into a list of marks.
	- Add the marks to the dictionary.
	- Convert the dictionary to a DataFrame.

5. Drop any columns in the DataFrame that contain the same value from start to end.

6. Save the DataFrame to a CSV file.
