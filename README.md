* The Problem - Our teachers of SJCET Palai are wasting a good amount of their time entering marks scored by students on individual questions in an exam to excel sheets.

* The Solution - We need to automate the task of entering the marks, for that we use a combination of detection, extraction & recognition algorithms

<!-- 
#### This is not exactly an automated data entry software, but it is a telegram bot linked application to make (pre-customized) Excel sheet out of Mark sheet (uploaded as PDF)

---

## Working of the App

* User starts the telegram bot (`bot_name`) â†’ click or tpye `/start`
* User sends the `PDF file` having front pages of Stundent's Marksheet
* User waits to receive the `CSV file` containing students name, marks entered in respective columns

## Why not a `WhatsApp Bot`?

WhatsApp also has good features of BOTS. But if we need to build a bot we need:

* A separate mobile number to start WhatsApp Business account
* WhatsApp Business API is paid
* Lack of functionalities & developer support
* Centralized, owned by Meta Platforms (Facebook)
