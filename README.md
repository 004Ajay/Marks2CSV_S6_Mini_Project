## Why not a `WhatsApp Bot`?

WhatsApp also has good features of BOTS. But if we need to build a bot we need:

* A separate mobile number to start WhatsApp Business account
* WhatsApp Business API is paid
* Lack of functionalities & developer support
* Centralized, owned by Meta Platforms (Facebook)
