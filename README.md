## Problem & Solution

* The Problem - Our teachers of SJCET Palai are wasting a good amount of their time entering marks scored by students on individual questions in an exam to excel sheets.

* The Solution - We need to automate the task of entering the marks, for that we use a combination of detection, extraction & recognition algorithms

## FAQ

### Why not a `WhatsApp Bot`?

WhatsApp also has good features of BOTS. But if we need to build a bot we need:

* A separate mobile number to start WhatsApp Business account
* WhatsApp Business API is paid
* Lack of functionalities & developer support
* Centralized, owned by Meta Platforms (Facebook)
